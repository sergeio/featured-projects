Hello!

This is a collection of some of my personal projects that I like
best.  The down-arrow button loads more information about each
project, and the github icon will take you to the repository.

If any of the fancy ajaxy things aren't playing well with your
browser, or if you just plain don't like them, **click on the github
icons**, and you can get the exact same content on nice, sane, static
pages.  This page is my excuse to try out React.js. :)

You can browse the rest of my public projects on
[github](http://github.com/sergeio).
